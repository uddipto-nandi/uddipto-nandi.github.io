# Lab 1.4 : Reading Digimon

## Objectives:
Reading and processing a csv file of Digimon using Python in Visual Studio Code using variables, lists, dictionaries, funnctions, and for loops. 

## Tasks:

### Set-Up
Before we can move on to the actual tasks we have to first open the csv in the vs code file, so that it can be read and processed later on. 

This is how I opened the Digimon csv for this lab:
```
import csv

data = None
with open("./datasets/digimon.csv") as f:
        data = list(csv.DictReader(f))
```
This section of code serves to do two things, first open the digimon.csv, and to store the data as a list called data. Since the with statement automatically returns the data from the csv has to be stored so that it can be accessed later on for the tasks. 

### Task 1: Digimon Average Speed
The objective of this task was to find the average speed of all of the digimon in the list data. To do this I first created a list to store the speeds (list_spds) of all of the digimon and stored them in that list iterating through the digimon in data and appending thier speed values to list_spds. 

This was achieved through this snippet of code:

```
list_spds = []
        for digimon in data: 
                spd = digimon["Spd"]
                list_spds.append(digimon["Spd"])
```
Now that all of the digimon speeds were isolated from the data and placed into a list called list_spds, we can find the average digimon speed by iterating through the data and adding all of the digimon speeds to a variable called total_spd and by counting how many digimon's speeds have been added and then divding the total by the counter variable. The for loop created for this purpose is shown below.
```
```
