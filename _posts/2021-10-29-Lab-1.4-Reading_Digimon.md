title: Lab 1.4 - Reading Digimon 
subtitle: Uddipto Nandi

## Objectives:
Reading and processing a csv file of Digimon using Python in Visual Studio Code using variables, lists, dictionaries, funnctions, and for loops. 

## Tasks:

### Set-Up
Before we can move on to the actual tasks we have to first open the csv in the vs code file, so that it can be read and processed later on. 

This is how I opened the Digimon csv for this lab:
```
import csv

data = None
with open("./datasets/digimon.csv") as f:
        data = list(csv.DictReader(f))
```
This section of code serves to do two things, first open the digimon.csv, and to store the data as a list called data. Since the with statement automatically returns the data from the csv has to be stored so that it can be accessed later on for the tasks. 

### Task 1: Digimon Average Speed
The objective of this task was to find the average speed of all of the digimon in the list data. To do this I first created a list to store the speeds (list_spds) of all of the digimon and stored them in that list iterating through the digimon in data and appending thier speed values to list_spds. 

This was achieved through this snippet of code:

```
list_spds = []
        for digimon in data: 
                spd = digimon["Spd"]
                list_spds.append(digimon["Spd"])
```
Now that all of the digimon speeds were isolated from the data and placed into a list called list_spds, we can find the average digimon speed by iterating through the data and adding all of the digimon speeds to a variable called total_spd and by counting how many digimon's speeds have been added and then divding the total by the counter variable. The for loop created for this purpose is shown below.
```
average_speed = 0
        total_spd = 0
        counter = 0

        for spd in list_spds:
                counter += 1
                total_spd += int(spd) 
        average_speed = total_spd/counter 
        print (average_speed)
        return
```
* Notice how the variables are defined outside of the for loop? It is incredibly important that the variables aree defined outside of the for loop so that the variables aren't reset everytime the for loop loops!
 
** Alo notice the int(spd) in the line total_spd += int(spd)? That is to convert the speed being added onto the variable total variable into an integer, since it was stored in the list list_spds as a string. This is necessary because total_spd is an int, so to add the speeds of the digimon to the variable total_spds the speed being added has to be an integer. Also this is important so that it can be divided in the end by the variable counter which is also an int. 

This code is run using the following line of code: 
```
avg_spd()
```
There is no input taken by the function because of the fact that list data can just be used directly in the fucntion without being passed in. Sometimes it is important to have inputs so that the code can be us
ed for multiple datasets but in this scenario we are only working with the dataset of digimon. 

The code runs and prints out 70, meaning that the average speed of all od the digimon is 70. 

### Task 2 : Counting Digimon with Specific Attributes (Collaborated with Claire)

The objective of this task is to tally the number of Digimon with a certain value in a certain data type. For this code we will check with the test case "Type", "Vaccine". When these two are passed in the function should return 70 because there are 70 digimon with the Type Vaccine in the data set. 

This is actually a suprisingly easy task to code even though it has to be completely soft-coded and has to work for any attribute of digmon that can be counted. 

The function and call statement is shown below: 
```
def count_digimon(data_type, value): # Since these are variables the data_type/variable that you want to count can be any of the variables that the individual digimon have
        counter = 0

        for digimon in data:
         if digimon[data_type] == value:
                counter +=1
        print(counter)
        return
```
This code iterates through the list "data" to count how many digimon have a particular value of a certain data type. This is done in the lines "if digimon[data_type] == value:/counter +=1." So for example when the parameters Type and Vaccine are passed in, this function iterates through the dataset checking the type of all of the digimon and adding 1 to the counter variable if the type if Vaccine. 

When the function is called for the parameters Type and Vaccine like in the lines of code shown below, the function returns the correct number of digimon, 70.
```
count_digimon("Type", "Vaccine")
```

### Task 3:
